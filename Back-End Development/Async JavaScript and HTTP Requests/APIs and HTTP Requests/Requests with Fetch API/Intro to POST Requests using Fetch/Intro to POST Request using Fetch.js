Intro to POST Requests using Fetch
In the previous exercise, we successfully wrote a GET request using the fetch API and handled Promises to get word suggestions from Datamuse. Give yourself a pat on the back (or two to treat yourself)!

Now, weâ€™re going to learn how to use fetch() to construct POST requests!

Take a look at the diagram to the right. It has the boilerplate code for a POST request using fetch().

Notice that the fetch() call takes two arguments: an endpoint and an object that contains information needed for the POST request.

The object passed to the fetch() function as its second argument contains two properties: method, with a value of 'POST', and body, with a value of JSON.stringify({id: '200'});. This second argument determines that this request is a POST request and what information will be sent to the API.

A successful POST request will return a response body, which will vary depending on how the API is set up.

The rest of the request is identical to the GET request. A .then() method is chained to the fetch() function to check and return the response as well as throw an exception when a network error is encountered. A second .then() method is added on so that we can use the response however we may choose.

// fetch POST
fetch("http://api-to-call.com/endpoint", {
    method: "POST",
    body: JOSN.stringify({id: "200"})
}).then(response=>{
    if(response.ok){
        return response.json();
    }
    thow new Error("Request failed!");
}, networkError=> console.log(networkError.message)
).then(jsonResponse=>{
    // Code to execute with jsonResponse
});
