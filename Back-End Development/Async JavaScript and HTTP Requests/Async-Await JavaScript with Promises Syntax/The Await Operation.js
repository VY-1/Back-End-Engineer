/*
The await Operator
In the last exercise, we covered the async keyword. By itself, it doesn’t do much; async functions are almost always used with the additional keyword await inside the function body.

The await keyword can only be used inside an async function. await is an operator: it returns the resolved value of a promise. Since promises resolve in an indeterminate amount of time, await halts, or pauses, the execution of our async function until a given promise is resolved.

In most situations, we’re dealing with promises that were returned from functions. Generally, these functions are through a library, and, in this lesson, we’ll be providing them. We can await the resolution of the promise it returns inside an async function. In the example below, myPromise() is a function that returns a promise which will resolve to the string "I am resolved now!".

async function asyncFuncExample(){
  let resolvedValue = await myPromise();
  console.log(resolvedValue);
}

asyncFuncExample(); // Prints: I am resolved now!

Within our async function, asyncFuncExample(), we use await to halt our execution until myPromise() is resolved and assign its resolved value to the variable resolvedValue. Then we log resolvedValue to the console. We’re able to handle the logic for a promise in a way that reads like synchronous code.
